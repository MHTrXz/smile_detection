# Smile Detection Project

This project implements a real-time smile detection system using a fine-tuned model. The workflow includes fine-tuning the model in `detection_model.ipynb` and using the trained weights in `smile_detection.py` for live webcam detection.


## Features

* *Fine-Tuning*: Train the smile detection model using detection_model.ipynb on your custom dataset.
* *Real-Time Smile Detection*: Run the fine-tuned model on webcam feeds for live smile classification.
* *EfficientNet Architecture*: Uses a modified EfficientNet for accurate and efficient smile detection.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```


### 2. Fine-Tune the Model

1. Open `detection_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
  * Load and preprocess your dataset.
  * Fine-tune the EfficientNet-based model for smile detection.
  * Save the trained model as `model.pth`.

### 3. Run Smile Detection

After fine-tuning the model, run the real-time detection script:

```
python smile_detection.py  
```

### 4. Exit the Webcam Feed

Press `q` to quit the webcam feed.


## Notes

* Ensure the `model.pth` file is present in the project directory before running `smile_detection.py`.
* Modify the Haar cascade or preprocessing parameters if needed for your specific use case.
* The project supports custom datasets for training in `detection_model.ipynb`.
